		<h3>OverView: </h3>
		<p id="OverView">Aries, you have had transiting Uranus in Aries conjuncting your Sun sign since March 12, 2011 . Having fun yet? Uranus is known as the awakener. What have you awakened to? Uranus shocks, stimulates, brings sudden and unexpected events. What has it done in your life so far? Uranus can change our lives suddenly, unexpectedly, bring people back into our lives that were gone a long time or take people out of our lives that were very important to us. Without a doubt, Uranus can bring in new circumstances, new people, and old acquaintances; even alter our life style suddenly or ever so subtly.</p>

		<p>But, remember to make out those lists. Find the time to stay as organized as you possibly can. Making lists helps to keep focused and to stay sane and not so irritable. Oh, yes, expect to continue to be outspoken, because there is no way back to who you used to be. Actually, you will be a much better personality, because you will be yourself and you will sour with the eagles, crying out – FREEDOM.</p>

		
		<h3>Carrer: </h3>

		<h3>OverView: </h3>
		<p id="OverView">Sagittarius, you have had transiting Uranus in Sagittarius conjuncting your Sun sign since March 12, 2011 . Having fun yet? Uranus is known as the awakener. What have you awakened to? Uranus shocks, stimulates, brings sudden and unexpected events. What has it done in your life so far? Uranus can change our lives suddenly, unexpectedly, bring people back into our lives that were gone a long time or take people out of our lives that were very important to us. Without a doubt, Uranus can bring in new circumstances, new people, and old acquaintances; even alter our life style suddenly or ever so subtly.</p>

		<p>But, remember to make out those lists. Find the time to stay as organized as you possibly can. Making lists helps to keep focused and to stay sane and not so irritable. Oh, yes, expect to continue to be outspoken, because there is no way back to who you used to be.
