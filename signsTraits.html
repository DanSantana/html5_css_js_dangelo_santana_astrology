	<p>The people born under this sign are humanitarian and are intent on making the world a better place for everyone around. These are philosophers and visionary souls who keeps thinking about the betterment of the world in general. These people are sensitive and even vulnerable. Despite being surrounded by many, in reality these are lonely people. They rarely have what can be called close people. These people however are often associated with lot of organizations, clubs etc. having too little friends in the true sense of the term, they love those that are there for them.</p>

	<p>Their sign of the water bearer is symbolic of their sign actually. Just as the water is a precious gift brought forward, in the same manner these people also bring forth their thoughts and views to this world.</p>

	<p>Aquarius is ruled by the powerful Saturn and Uranus.  The combination powers of these two planets are pretty strong. They turn out to be extremely good communicators as long as the communication and topics are within the mental realm of their own.</p>

	<p>The Aquarius born people are intelligent and quick witted. They have an unusual capacity of picking up things real fast and are innately curious about everything around them. However these are also reasons which destroy their power of concentrating on a certain thing for long.</p>
